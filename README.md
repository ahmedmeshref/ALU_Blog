# ALU_Blog
**Version 1.0.0**

The African Leadership University is growing with two communities, one in Rwanda and another in Mauritius. 
From an institutional level, both campuses might be well linked and growing together under one institution. 
But, from the students' perspective, each community is separated and there doesn’t exist one platform that 
brings both communities together to facilitate and encourage the process of communication between members, 
opportunities and experience sharing between students, … etc. ALU Blog platform is meant to be a joint to 
link both communities together under one platform with all staff and students from both campuses together
 to share and discuss news, opportunities, issues, … etc.
