# ALU_Blog
**Version 1.0.0**

The African Leadership University is growing with two communities, one in Rwanda and another in Mauritius. 
From an institutional level, both campuses might be well linked and growing together under one institution. But, 
from the students'perspective, each community is separated and there is one platform that brings both communities 
together to facilitate and encourage the process of communication between them, opportunities sharing between students, 
… etc. ALU Blog platform is meant to be a joint to link both communities together under one platform with all staff and 
 students from both campuses together to share news, opportunities, issues, … etc.
